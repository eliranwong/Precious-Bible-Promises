Introduction
Containing

Some Observations upon the Excellency and Use of the Promises, and Directions for the right Application of them.

Besides the many other evidences the Holy Scripture carries in it of a Divine Original, there are especially remarkable the Sublimity, Excellency and Reasonableness of the Doctrine it teaches; the Wisdom, Holiness, and Perfection of the Rules of Life it lays down; and the Strength and Efficacy of those Sanctions, with which it enforces its Precepts. As the Threatenings have the greatest Tendency to strike an Awe upon the Mind, and to lay a powerful Restraint upon every irregular Inclination, so the Promises are of such a Nature as most strongly to excite to, and give the greatest Encouragement in, a Course of Piety and universal Holiness. It is therefore with the highest Reason the Apostle says of them, That there are given unto us exceeding great and precious Promises, that by these we might be Partakers of the Divine Nature, having escaped the Corruption that is in the World through Lust, <ref onclick="bcv(61,1,4)">2Pet. 1:4</ref>. They are great and excellent; whether we consider the Nature and Variety of the Blessings contained in them, or their happy influence upon the Mind.

They contain Blessings of all Sorts, of the most excellent Nature, and suited to every Circumstance. As Man is made up of Body as well as Spirit, and the Necessities of this present Life must be provided for, as well as his Happiness secured in the next; in the Promises abundant Care is taken of both, and Provision is made for the Peace, Comfort, and Welfare of the Christian, both in this, and in the other World. He is assured of the several Necessaries and Conveniences of this Life, in such a measure, as Infinite Wisdom sees best for him. And since we are exposed to various Troubles and Calamities, there are many Promises made with relation to them; either that we shall be preserved from those Afflictions, or, if it be necessary we should be exercised with them, that we shall be powerfully supported under them, and in the best Time and Way, delivered from them, after that they have been made to answer the most excellent Ends upon us. Nor is it easy to say, what a vast Variety of Consolations are provided for our Relief in those Trials. But, however valuable, considering the Circumstances of our present State, the Promises relating to Temporal Enjoyments and Afflictions, may be, they are not to be compared with the Excellency and Glory of those Spiritual and Eternal Blessings, with which we are blessed in Christ Jesus, and of which we have the most clear, full and express Promises in the Gospel. Therein, how great, how particular a Regard is had to the Condition of fallen, sinful Man! What Care is taken to ease the Conscience under the Burden of Guilt, and the Apprehensions of Divine Wrath, by the most gracious Promises of Pardon and Mercy! What Assurances given of Reconciliation and Acceptance with God, through the Blood and Intercession of the Redeemer! To what glorious Privileges and high Honours is the Christian advanced! Such as, The Adoption of Children, A kind Regard to all his Prayers, The Ministry of Angels, and An Interest in the Grace, Love and Fellowship of God the Father, and of his Eternal Son and Spirit. In the Promises is contained all that Grace which is requisite to refine and enoble our Natures, to inlighten our Understandings, to regulate our Wills, and purify our Affections; to preserve us from Sin, and all the Contrivances and Snares of the Devil and the World, and to exalt us to the highest Perfection of Holiness and Happiness.

The manner in which these Blessings are promised, still further adds to their Value. They are not expressed in general or ambiguous Terms, but with the greatest Clearness and Perspicuity. God would not leave his People at an Uncertainty, concerning his kind Intentions towards them. If the Meaning of a Promise seems doubtful in one Place, it is abundantly cleared up in several others. Nor is it only here and there in some few Passages, or in a cold and reserved Manner, that God has signified his good Will; but, upon the Account of our Dulness and Slowness to believe what God has promised. he has both made use of the strongest Words and Phrases that Language could furnish out, and has over and over, in great Variety of Expression, often repeated the Assurances of his Favour. He has contrived his Promises so as to meet with all our Objections, and remove all our Doubts and Fears; And herein he has been pleased to shew an Affection, Tenderness, and Condescention, which could not be expected from an earthly Prince to his Subjects, much less from the Great and Glorious Majesty of Heaven and Earth to sinful Dust and Ashes.

But what doth in the highest Degree inhance the Worth and Excellency of the Promises, is the Evidences we have that they shall certainly be made good; since, as the Apostle argues, <ref onclick="bcv(58,6,17)">Heb. 6:17</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(58,6,18)">18</ref>, we have for them both the Word and Oath of that God who cannot lye, that so we might have strong Consolation, who have fled for Refuge, to lay hold upon the Hope that is set before us. And of the Covenant thus confirmed, Christ the Son of God is made Surety, <ref onclick="bcv(58,7,22)">Heb. 7:22</ref>, having ratified it by his own Blood. And that all the Ever-blessed Trinity might concur in establishing our Faith upon the strongest Foundation, the Holy Spirit of God witnesses the Truth of the Promises, by his miraculous Operations, when first poured forth upon the Apostles, and by his sanctifying Influences upon the Hearts of all true Christians, both then and ever-since. Hereby he inspires into them a lively Hope, and furnishes them with well-grounded Evidences of their Interest in the Promises; and their Hope makes them not ashamed, because the Love of God is shed abroad in their Hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto them, <ref onclick="bcv(45,5,5)">Rom. 5:5</ref>.

The Promises therefore of the Gospel being of so excellent a Nature, and confirmed to us by such Authority and Evidence, cannot but have very great and happy Influences upon the Mind, when seriously attended to, and applied with Faith; especially as they are the Means by which the Spirit of God carries on his Work upon the Soul. They are the strongest Arguments to persuade the Sinner to turn to God, the greatest Encouragement to a humble, believing Dependance upon the Grace of Christ in the Gospel, and the most powerful Motives to sincere and universal Obedience: Since by them we are assured, that every penitent Sinner shall find the most gracious Acceptance; that from the Grace of Christ we shall derive sufficient Strength and Capacity for every Duty; and that in keeping God's Commands there is great Reward. So that would we but duly consider the several Promises made to every Performance of Duty, what a Spur would this be to quicken our slow Pace in the Ways of Holiness! What an Encouragement to be stedfast and inmovable, always abounding in the Work of the Lord. forasmuch as we know that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord, <ref onclick="bcv(46,15,58)">1Cor. 15:58</ref>.

A Fixed, constant Attention to the Promises, and a firm Belief of them, would prevent Solicitude and Anxiety about the Concerns of this Life. It would keep the Mind quiet and compos'd in every Change, and support and keep up our sinking Spirits under the several Troubles of Life. In the multitude of my Thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul, <ref onclick="bcv(19,94,19)">Ps. 94:19</ref>. Christians deprive themselves of their most solid Comforts by their Unbelief and Forgetfulness of God's Promises. For there is no Extremity so great, but there are Promises suitable to it, and abundantly sufficient for our Relief in it.

A thorough Acquaintance with the Promises would be of the greatest Advantage in Prayer. With what Comfort may the Christian address himself to God in Christ, when he considers the repeated Assurances that his Prayers shall be heard? With how much satisfaction may he offer up the several Desires of his Heart, when he reflects upon the Texts wherein those very Mercies are promised? And with what Fervour of Spirit, and Strength of Faith, may he enforce his Prayers, by pleading the several gracious Promises, which are expressly to his Case?

Further, Great Assistance and Encouragement may the Christian derive in his Spiritual Warfare, when he takes a View of the many Promises of Grace and Strength to mortify Sin, and to resist the Devil; of Success and a final Victory in his Conflicts with the Enemies of his Salvation; and of an incorruptible Crown of Glory, to be given him as the Reward of his Firmness, Constancy, and Perseverance. A great deal more may be said, but that I would not too much enlarge this Introduction, to shew of what excellent Use the Promises would be if duly attended to, to promote all the Exercises of the Divine Life, and inspire into a good Man Comfort and Joy in every State of Life.

That the Christian might have before him, in one View, the many great and precious Promises scattered up and down in Scripture, and in such a Method as easily to find what is suitable to his Case, I have drawn up the following Collection. The Occasion indeed, of my first entering upon it, was to assist some Young Persons, who very commendably and to their great Advantage, are employ'd in improving themselves, and one another, in the Knowledge of the Scriptures; one of their Exercises being to Treasure up in their Memories, and question one another upon the Promises, under their several Heads. At first I intended to put together a small Number, upon some principal Subjects; but, upon searching the Scriptures more and more Texts still offering themselves, which I thought equally to my purpose, this Collection at length grew so large, that the taking so many Copies as were wanted, would have been a tedious Work; For which Reason, and in hopes it might serve the same useful End to others, I at last gave way to its being made publick. Since I compleated it, I have examined some other Collections I have met with, and have added out of them those few texts, which I had not before observed; So that, I believe, this is the fullest Collection of the kind of any extant, at least that I have seen.

I have endeavour'd to put them together in such a Method as might be easiest and fittest for common Use. I have not increased the Heads to so great a Variety of Particulars as some may expect; both because too many Divisions rather confound than assist the Memory; and also the applying of the Promises to cases too particular, would have too much confin'd their Use, when capable of a more extensive Application. If any therefore want the Promises for some Case they don't find mentioned, they may meet with them under some more general Head, within which that Case is comprehended. And for the same Reason, some of the Promises may seem not so properly to belong to the Head under which they are ranged; but as they are near a-kin to it, I chose rather to put them together, than to multiply Heads. There are also other Texts, which some may think should have been placed elsewhere; For instance, some of the Promises under the Head of Temporal Blessings, are by some understood in a Figurative Sense of Spiritual, and so on the contrary. I have taken them in the Sense that appeared to me most agreeable to the Design of the Spirit of God; though sometimes, where I thought the Words were capable of both Senses, I have written them in both Places. Many other Texts also might be ranged under different Heads; for Example, either in the First Part, among the Blessings promised; or in the Second, containing the Graces and Duties to which Promises are made; and sometimes under either of those Heads, which being nearly related, follow one the other; as the Head of Sanctifying Grace in general, and Converting Grace. If therefore what you look for be not in one Place, you may expect to find it in the other. For which Purpose the References in the Table of Contents will be useful; for I have generally endeavoured to avoid Repetitions. Sometimes, indeed, the same Text may be met with in different Places, but then it is applied to different Purposes; as when several Blessings or Duties are comprized in one, as <ref onclick="bcv(20,22,4)">Prov. 22:4</ref>.

Though all the Scriptures here collected under the Name of Promises are useful for the Comfort and Encouragement of Christians in the Cases specified; yet they are expressed in different Forms. Some contain direct Promises and Assurances of such and such Blessings. Of these, some are made to all in general, according to the Rules and Limitations of the Gospel; as <ref onclick="bcv(19,84,11)">Ps. 84:11</ref>, and <ref onclick="bcv(19,34,9)">Ps. 34:9</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(19,34,10)">10</ref>. But others are address'd to Particular good Men in Scripture, which yet every Christian may take Comfort in. So that Promise made to Joshua, Chap. 1:5, I will not fail thee nor forsake thee, is by the Apostle apply'd to Christians in general, <ref onclick="bcv(58,13,6)">Heb. 13:6</ref>. In the same manner, Promises made to particular Churches, are applicable to the Church of God in general; as those in the Old Testament to the Jewish Church, <ref onclick="bcv(23,27,3)">Is. 27:3</ref>, and <ref onclick="bcv(38,2,5)">Zech. 2:5</ref>, and those to the Churches in the New Testament, <ref onclick="bcv(50,4,19)">Phil. 4:19</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(45,16,20)">Rom. 16:20</ref>, and many more. The Rule in both these Cases, is That whatsoever Promises are made in Scripture to Particular Persons, in Cases, and for Reasons, that equally concern other good Men, they are applicable to the Comfort of all, and may be pleaded with Faith in Prayer. The Words of the Apostle afford a sufficient Foundation for this Observation, <ref onclick="bcv(45,15,4)">Rom. 15:4</ref>, Whatsoever Things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have Hope.

The Promises also made in particular Cases to Persons in Scripture, may be applied to the Encouragement of others, so far as the Case and Circumstances agree, though not absolutely, and in their whole Extent. Thus the Promise made to Solomon (<ref onclick="bcv(14,1,11)">2 Chron. 1:11</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(14,1,13)">13</ref>.) of Wisdom, and also of Riches and Honour, beyond all that were before him, because he asked of God Wisdom rather than Riches, & c., is applicable to Solomon only, in its whole extent; but yet gives Encouragement to every good Man to hope, that if he seek of God Wisdom above all other Things, he shall obtain a large Measure of it, according to what his Station requires, and also so much of other worldly Advantages as God sees best for him, according to those more general Promises, <ref onclick="bcv(20,8,17)">Prov. 8:17</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(20,8,18)">18</ref>. In the same manner the Promises made by Christ to his Apostles of the Holy Spirit, to teach them all Things, and bring all Things he had said to them to remembrance, <ref onclick="bcv(43,14,26)">John 14:26</ref>, and to guide them into all Truth, Chap. 16:13, though they are not to be apply'd to others in the same degree as to the other Apostles, who were by the Spirit extraordinarily inspir'd and instructed in the whole Revelation of the Gospel, and infallibly secured from Error, this being peculiar to their Character as Apostles; yet they encourage all other Christians to expect from the Spirit all that Illumination, Instruction, and Guidance which is necessary for them in their several Circumstances, upon the diligent Use of all appointed Means, so that they shall be preserved from all dangerous and fatal Mistakes and Errors, according to those Promises, <ref onclick="bcv(62,2,20)">1John 2:20</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(62,2,27)">27</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(19,25,12)">Ps. 25:12</ref>, and others; Divine Guidance [<ref onclick="bcv(19,13,3)">Ps. 13:3</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(19,73,24)">73:24</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(23,49,10)">Is. 49:10</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(23,49,11)">11</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(23,61,8)">61:8</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(5,32,10)">Deut. 32:10</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(5,32,11)">11</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(23,30,21)">Is. 30:21</ref>] and Promises of a Blessing [<ref onclick="bcv(19,65,4)">Ps. 65:4</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(19,68,24)">68:24</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(19,84,4)">84:4</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(19,84,10)">10</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(19,84,11)">11</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(19,89,15)">89:15</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(19,89,16)">16</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(19,92,13)">92:13</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(22,2,3)">Song of Solomon 2:3</ref>], made to good men in general.

Besides those Scriptures that run in the Form of Promises, there are others which are Observations or Declarations of the Blessings that generally attend the several Exercises of Piety and Holiness; as <ref onclick="bcv(19,111,5)">Ps. 111:5</ref> and <ref onclick="bcv(20,18,10)">Prov. 18:10</ref>, and most of those collected out of the Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. But as these are Observations made under the Inspiration of the Spirit of God, they give the same Encouragement to expect the Blessings mentioned in them, as if they were in the Form of Promises.

Some of the Texts do only express the Experiences of good Men in Scripture, or their Expectations from God; as <ref onclick="bcv(19,16,6)">Ps. 16:6</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(19,23,1)">Ps. 23</ref> throughout, and <ref onclick="bcv(19,71,20)">Ps. 71:20</ref>. Of which Scriptures the same may be said as of those above. That as Holy Men therein spake under the Direction of the Spirit of God, and what they say of themselves is recorded for our Instruction and Comfort, consequently other good Men may assure themselves, in like Circumstances, of the like Favour and Mercy. Thus, whereas the Psalmist expresses his Confidence in God's Help against all his Enemies, <ref onclick="bcv(19,118,6)">Ps. 118:6</ref>, the Apostle applies it to all Christians, <ref onclick="bcv(58,13,6)">Heb. 13:6</ref>. So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my Helper, and I will not fear what Man can do unto me.

Some of the Texts are Petitions put up by Christ for his Church; as those taken out of <ref onclick="bcv(43,17,1)">John 17</ref>. These give the same Encouragement as the Promises do; for we are assured that whatever Christ asks for his People, is certainly granted.

The same may be said, in some Degree, of the Prayers put up by other Saints in Scripture, for themselves and others; especially the Prophetical Prayers, <ref onclick="bcv(1,49,1)">Gen. 49</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(5,32,1)">Deut. 32</ref>, and in other Places. Since those Prayers were deliver'd under the Inspiration of the Spirit, we know they were agreeable to the Will of God; and so far as Circumstances are the same, all other good Men may hope to be heard in asking the same Blessings of God. But of this Sort I've taken but few, both because it is more difficult rightly and with Judgment to apply them, and lest I should too much swell this Collection.

The Blessings promised, are either of a Temporal, or of a Spiritual and Eternal Nature; It may be necessary to lay down some Rules, to direct the serious Christian in the right Application of these different Sorts of Promises.

As to the Promises of Temporal Blessings, and those that relate to Temporal Evils, it is acknowledged by all, they are not to be understood Absolutely or Universally, but with the Limitation, as far as may be for God's Glory, and our Good; both which are, in effect, One. Nor will these Limitations lessen their Value, with any thinking, serious Person. For all outward Things are of such a Nature, as to be capable of being either good or evil to us, as Circumstances vary. Riches, though in some Circumstances they may be very useful and valuable, in which Case God will bestow them according to the Tenour of his Promises; yet in others they may be, and often prove, very pernicious: No wise Man, in that Case, would desire them. Thus Afflictions, in some Instances, may be of the greatest Advantage to us. Then they are Mercies: The inflicting them is a Token of Favour, and the preventing them would be a Judgment, instead of fulfilling a Promise. Now it must be allowed, that of all these Circumstances, the Infinitely Wise and Good God is the best Judge; since he has before him, in one View, the whole Compass of every Case, in all its Circumstances, and is more concern'd and watchful for our Good than we can be ourselves. The Promises therefore relating to these Things, should not lie by neglected; but we should fix our Faith upon them for the Mercies we want, with a firm Dependance upon the Power and Faithfulness of God, though with an entire Submission to his superior Wisdom, to choose what is best for us. I verily believe Christians often deprive themselves even of Temporal Favours from God for want of a more frequent, stedfast Exercise of Faith upon the Promises relating to these Things. They either ask not, or not in Faith, and therefore receive nothing from God, <ref onclick="bcv(59,1,6)">Jam. 1:6</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(59,1,7)">7</ref>. Or, they desire and ask but not for right Ends (to take Notice of another Limitation hinted at by the same Apostle, <ref onclick="bcv(59,5,3)">Jam. 5:3</ref>,) not for God's Honour, but to consume it upon their Lusts; and so they ask amiss, and therefore receive not. This Collection therefore will give great Assistance to the Faith of Christians when they observe how full and express the Promises are, and how suitable to their several Exigencies, even in Things concerning this Life.

It may be objected to many of the Texts that they are taken out of the Old Testament, and were Promises made to the Jews under a Dispensation, wherein a greater Stress is laid upon Temporal Blessings, than under the Gospel; and consequently, that Christians can't expect so much from those Promises.

I answer, That it is true, the Gospel has a much greater Tendency to draw our Affections from, and lessen our Regard to Outward Felicity and Prosperity, than the Law, since it has brought in a better Hope, and gives more clear Discoveries and more full Assurances of Spiritual and Eternal Blessings, and recommends these as our main Concern: And therefore our Desires and Expectations of Temporal Blessings ought to be very moderate, and bear no Proportion with our Concern for Spiritual. But yet, that Christians may take Comfort in, and apply to themselves the Promises of the Old Testament, and in Things relating to this Life, is evident from that Declaration of the Apostle, <ref onclick="bcv(54,5,8)">1Timothy 5:8</ref>, Godliness is profitable unto all Things, having Promise of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come. Where the Apostle affirms, not only that Godliness is profitable to this, as well as another Life, but that it has Promises relating to both; by which it is probable he meant those of the Old Testament, a great part of the New being not then committed to Writing, or not published among the Churches. Besides, as was observed before, the Promises made in the Old Testament the Apostle applies to Christians, and that upon the Principle above-mentioned, <ref onclick="bcv(45,15,4)">Rom. 15:4</ref>. An Instance of which we have, among others, in his pressing Obedience to Parents on Christians, <ref onclick="bcv(49,6,2)">Eph. 6:2</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(49,6,3)">3</ref>, from the Temporal Promise annex'd to the Fifth Commandment, deliver'd to the Jews. To which may be added, That there are many Promises of Temporal Blessings to be found in the Gospel, as full and as expressive as those in the Old Testament, as will appear upon the Perusal of this Collection.

Nor do I think the Case of Good Men under the Law so different from that of Christians with relation to Outward Blessings as some may apprehend. It is plain, those Promises were not to them absolute or universal, but to be understood with the same limitations as now; and that in those Times, as well as since, the Righteous were frequently exercis'd with severe Afflictions, and the Wicked had many Times a greater Share of Outward Prosperity than even the best of Men; the want of a due Attention to which was the Reason of the heavy Censures Job met with from his Friends. The Sentences therefore which in Job, in the Proverbs, and in other Places, express the Earthly Advantages attending Righteousness in its several Branches, and the ill Consequences of Vice are not to be look'd upon as universal Positions, but rather as Observations of the proper Tendency of Virtue and Vice, and their natural Connection with such and such Benefits and Mischiefs, though liable to some Exceptions in particular Cases, as most general Observations and Maxims are. And there is now the same Connection established by God in the Course of Things between Moral Good and Evil; and several Advantages and Mischiefs, though subject to such Variations as God, in his wise Providence, sees fit to make from his more settled Rules.

As to the Promises of Spiritual and Eternal Blessings, they are to be apply'd according to the Tenour of the Gospel. It is to Faith, Repentance, Love, and sincere Obedience, that the Promises in general are made of Pardon, Grace, and Glory; as appears from a great Multitude of Texts here collected. And indeed, without these Dispositions, none can justly lay claim to any of the Temporal Promises. But because, in many Cases, a serious Person may be doubtful whether he is converted or not, whether there be in him that Faith, Repentance, and Holiness, which may be a Proof that he is in a State of Favour with God, and so entitled to those Promises, I observe, That as there is a Difference between Grace begun, in its first Exercises, and when it is arrived to a confirm'd Habit, so many of the Promises are made to the first Beginnings and Exercises of Grace, in praying and seeking after God, in the Use of appointed Means, in turning from Sin and coming to Christ. Thus the Promises of a new Heart are made to those who enquire after God, <ref onclick="bcv(26,36,26)">Ezek. 36:26</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(26,36,37)">37</ref>, of Wisdom to them that search for it, <ref onclick="bcv(20,2,4)">Prov. 2:4</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(20,2,5)">5</ref>, of the Spirit to them that ask it, <ref onclick="bcv(42,11,13)">Luke 11:13</ref>, and of Rest in Christ to them that being weary and heavy laden, come to him, <ref onclick="bcv(40,11,28)">Matt. 11:28</ref>. Which therefore every one who finds in himself those Beginnings of Grace, may apply them to himself, as an Encouragement to go on.

It is also to be observed, That the other Promises of Divine Influences, of the Increase of Grace, of Preservation from sin, of Grace to persevere to the End, & c., and so of everlasting Life and Glory, tho' every sincere Christian may apply them, and depend upon them, yet they all suppose the diligent Use of all the Means of Grace, Watchfulness, a constant Application to, and Dependance upon, the Strength of Christ, and the Grace of his Holy Spirit, and a sincere Regard to all the other Duties of the Gospel; as appears from <ref onclick="bcv(43,15,4)">John 15:4</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(43,15,10)">10</ref>, and many other Passages to be found in this Collection, especially in the latter Part.

To obtain the Comfort of the Promises in the Second Part, every one must see that they be in a good Degree possess'd of the Graces, and that they diligently perform the Duties, to which the Promises are made; and that from a Principle of Faith in Christ, and Love to God, express'd in an habitual Care and Endeavour to please him. For, whatever Duty we do, without a real Regard to God therein, depending upon Christ for Acceptance, in whom all the Promises are Yea and Amen, we can expect no Reward from Him.

God may justly reject such a Claim, with, Did ye it all to me? And for the same Reason, the observing of some Duties, while we knowingly allow ourselves in Acts of Disobedience to other Commands, will not support our Claim to the Promises; because, if we acted with a sincere Respect to God, we should shew the same Regard to all his known laws, <ref onclick="bcv(59,2,10)">Jam. 2:10</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(59,2,11)">11</ref>.

As a Christian ought to be concern'd not only for himself, but for the whole Church of God, and the Interest of Christ's Kingdom here on Earth, I thought it very necessary to lay before him what the Scripture affords for the raising of his Hopes, and encouraging his Prayers upon those important Subjects. And this is the Design of that Collection of Texts in the Appendix. But this I found more difficult than any other Part whatsoever. For, in searching the Scripture upon those Subjects, I met with so many Passages that had a relation to the State of the Church, that a compleat Collection of them was inconsistent with my intended Brevity; and many of the Prophecies were so difficult to be understood, that it could not be expected that the Generality of Christians should know how to make use of them. I have, however, endeavoured to avoid both these Inconveniences, by selecting those Texts which are most full to my purpose, and most easy to be apprehended by an attentive Reader; hoping that those Scriptures being here laid together, which treat of the same Subject, they would mutually illustrate and explain one another.

I am sensible that many of the Texts I have brought, which foretell the Enlargement and Glory of the Church, have already had, in some Degree, their Accomplishment, in the Conversion of the Gentiles to the Christian Faith; but upon a thorough Consideration of several of the Prophecies concerning the spreading of the Gospel throughout all Nations, the Subjection of all Kings to the Authority of Christ, and the Glorious State of the Church in the latter Days, as <ref onclick="bcv(19,86,9)">Ps. 86:9</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(23,66,18)">Is. 66:18</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(27,7,27)">Dan. 7:27</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(38,14,9)">Zech. 14:9</ref>, &c., it appears to me, there's still to be expected a fuller Accomplishment of them, than has yet been. But which have been already fulfilled, and which still remain to be so, I leave to every one's Judgment, upon considering and comparing the Texts.

Some of the Texts I have applied to the Church in general, are by some Interpreters understood of the Church of the Jews, when converted to Christ in the latter Ages of the World; as in <ref onclick="bcv(23,4,3)">Is. 4:3</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(23,27,6)">27:6</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(23,60,1)">Is. 60</ref> and 62. Nor do I deny, but it is probable, that People is more immediately pointed at in those Prophecies. But as the Gentile and Jewish Church will then be one, there will be a Communication of Privileges and Glory; and, consequently, in whatever Measures the Spirit of God is poured out, and the Glory of God manifested among the Jews, when converted, the Gentile Church will enjoy their Share of the Benefit: For, if the Fall of them be the Riches of the World, and the Diminishing of them the Riches of the Gentiles, How much more their Fulness? <ref onclick="bcv(45,11,12)">Rom. 11:12</ref>.

As to the Conversion of the Jews, it has indeed been the Opinion of many learned Men, that nothing more is to be expected, than what has already been done in the several, but especially the first Ages of Christianity; but I don't see what Sense can be made of the Eleventh Chapter to the Romans, but upon the Supposition of a further and more general Conversion of the Jews, even of that Part of the Jewish Nation which were then cut off from the true Church for their infidelity: And as the Apostle applies to this Purpose a Passage quoted out of one of the Prophets, it seems to me to serve as a Key for the right understanding of a great Number of Places in the Prophets concerning the State of the Jews in the latter Days; a great Part of which I have therefore collected, or referr'd to in the last Section. I know, indeed, those Prophecies are suppos'd by Grotius, and other learned Commentators, to have been fulfill'd by the Return of the Jews from the Babylonish Captivity, the Favour they obtain'd from several Princes, and the Victories gain'd by the Maccabees over the Enemies of the Jews. And perhaps the Foretelling of those remarkable Events, was in part the Design of at least some of those Prophecies. But they must be allow'd also to have had a further View, if we consider the low, afflicted, and persecuted State of the Jewish Nation most part of the Time after their Return to their own Land, under the Persian, Grecian, and at length the Roman Empire, and the Corruptions and Disorders that crept into, and at last quite over-run their Church; of which Dr. Prideaux has given a very full Account, in his excellent History. Now this no way agrees with those sublime and lively Descriptions of the Peace, Prosperity, Holiness, and flourishing Condition, both of their Church and State, foretold in those Prophecies; as particularly in <ref onclick="bcv(24,30,9)">Jer. 30:9</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(24,30,16)">16</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(26,34,28)">Ezek. 34:28</ref>, and 36:11, <ref onclick="bcv(29,3,17)">Joel 3:17</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(29,3,20)">20</ref>, &c. Besides that, in many of those Prophecies, the Latter Days, or the Days of the Messiah, are expressly pointed at, as the Time of their Accomplishment. This has therefore led many to apply all those Passages to the Gentile Church, which they suppose to be spoken of under Names and Characters proper to the Jewish Church as being typified by it. But whoever will carefully observe the Connection of the several Parts of those Prophecies, must acknowledge that the Jewish Nation is in some of the Verses plainly spoken of, and that in other Verses of the same Context, the Promises of Conversion and Restoration to their own Land, are made to the very same Persons; of which see Instances in the Chapters above-mention'd, and in <ref onclick="bcv(28,2,1)">Hos. 2</ref> and 3.

There are many indeed of those who expect a more general Conversion of the Jews, that yet will not admit of their Restoration to their own Land, but suppose they shall be, upon their Conversion, embodied with the several Nations among which they live. But in those Prophecies concerning them, which evidently refer to the Gospel Times, there are several Passages which speak so fully and positively of their Return to their own Country, and that Jerusalem shall be rebuilt and reinhabited by them, that it seems to me impossible to understand them in any other than the literal Sense, without doing them great Violence; as <ref onclick="bcv(24,32,41)">Jer. 32:41</ref> and 33:16, <ref onclick="bcv(26,36,11)">Ezek. 36:11</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(26,36,24)">24</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(26,36,28)">28</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(26,37,25)">37:25</ref>, <ref onclick="bcv(38,12,6)">Zech. 12:6</ref>; <ref onclick="bcv(38,14,11)">14:11</ref> &c. It is beyond my present Design, and the Compass of this Introduction, to give all the Reasons that incline me to these Sentiments: They that please to search further into the Matter, may consult Doctor Whitby, and other learned Writers. I shall conclude what I have to say upon this Head, with recommending it to Christians to make use of these Texts to raise their Hopes and Expectations of those future happy Times, when the Gospel shall be preach'd more universally throughout the World, the Christian Church receive a vast Accession by the calling of the Jews, and the Coming in of the Fulness of the Gentiles; and Holiness, Peace, and Love, shall flourish, probably in a greater measure than ever, at least since the Apostles' Times. Let this be the Subject of their daily and most fervent Prayers, and these Promises be made use of as Pleas to enforce their Petitions, and support their Faith.

Though this Collection has cost me not a little Time and Pains, I think it very well bestowed, not only upon the Account of the Advantage I have myself received from the Study of the Promises, and the Assistance I still expect from this Book for my private Thoughts and Composures for the Pulpit, by having it continually before me; but also in Hopes it may be useful to others in several Respects, for promoting the Holiness and Comfort of Christians. Here they have before them, in one View, the Riches of the Covenant of Grace: Here are all the strongest Arguments to persuade to real Religion, to recommend every Duty, and to support in every afflicted and perplexed Case. This Book may be very useful to assist in Prayer, both for the Reasons before-mentioned, and also because from hence one may be furnished with Variety of proper Matter and Expression upon all the Cases we are concerned to represent to God. And as the Study of these Promises would be to the Advantage of all sorts of Persons, it might be a very useful and easy Exercise for Children to be employ'd in learning some of the plainest Texts under those Heads which are most proper for them, and to question one another upon them, being instructed by their Teachers in their Sense and Use. In this Way the Directors of the Education of Children in the Charity Schools, may make this Book serve good Purposes, for the Instruction and Improvement of their Children in the Knowledge of the Scriptures. And I know of no better Way of enriching the Minds of Children with useful and solid Knowledge, than by making them well acquainted with the Scriptures themselves, those pure unmixed, Fountains of excellent and Divine Wisdom, and treasuring up in their Memories a great Number of select Scriptures most suited to their Capacity and Use. For this End, I have frequently thought of making some proper Collections, particularly for the Benefit of the Charity School at St. Albaus, and of all other Children, whose Parents or Teachers shall think fit to make use of them; which perhaps, * I may hereafter finish, if this meets with Acceptance.

[*Note: I had laid aside this Design upon finding that there was a Variety of such Collections already published. But as some Friends, to whom I have a great Regard, think something of that Nature more suited to the Instruction of Children is wanting, and therefore have put me lately upon it, I am now drawing up a small Collection for the Press.]

If we would reap the Comfort and Benefit of these Promises, it is not enough that we have them by us, or now and then look into them; but we must thoroughly acquaint ourselves with them, store them up in our Memories, and be often meditating upon them, that they may be ready for Use when we most want them. And whatever Pains we may be at on this Account, the Pleasure and Advantage we shall receive will be a sufficient Recompence: For these are pleasant Words, that are as a Honey-comb; sweet to the Soul, and Health to the Bones, <ref onclick="bcv(20,16,24)">Prov. 16:24</ref>, and therefore well deserve to be bound upon our Fingers, and written upon the Table of our Hearts, <ref onclick="bcv(20,7,3)">Prov. 7:3</ref>. And would serious Christians make the Promises the frequent Subject of their Conversation together, and at the same Time take notice of the several Instances wherein they have been made good to themselves, and others within their Observation, it would both impress them upon their Memories, and very much increase their Force and Influence upon their Hearts.

But Care must be taken to understand them in their true Sense, and rightly to apply them. Mistaken Apprehensions of Scripture, have often been the Cause of People deceiving themselves with ungrounded Comforts and Expectations; or, at least, they have not built their Comforts upon proper Texts, though they may have had sufficient Foundation for them in other Places. The comparing one Scripture with another, as they lie together, will be, in many Cases of great Use to assist in the right understanding of them. And in most Instances, it will be still a further Advantage to turn to the Place quoted and consider the Circumstances of the Text, and its Connection with the Context. This will shew how far there is an Agreement of your Case with that referr'd to in the Text; and, consequently, how far the Promise is to be applied, whether absolutely, and in its whole Extent, or only in some degree, and with Limitations.

In particular Cases, we may draw Comfort, not only from the Promises peculiar to that Case, but also from those that are of a more general Nature. As under Sickness, we may have Relief, not only from those Scriptures which expressly relate to that Circumstance, but also from the Promises relating to Trouble in general, and the Assurances of God's Love, Care, and Readiness to help his People, & c., which the Table of Contents will easily direct to.

That we may have the Comfort of the Promises, a steady Exercise of Faith is above all Things necessary. For this Purpose, we must impress upon our Minds the Power, Goodness, and Faithfulness of God, and the Experience of good Men in every Age; and by this Means, and by an attentive Consideration of the Promises, suck at those Breasts of Consolation till we be satisfied, <ref onclick="bcv(23,66,11)">Is. 66:11</ref>. But at the same Time our Eyes must be fixed upon the LORD Jesus Christ, as the only Foundation of our Hopes, in and through whom alone all the Promises are made good to us; and upon the Holy Spirit the Comforter, that through his powerful Influences we may rightly understand and apply, firmly believe, and clearly discover the Excellency of the Promises, and so taste that the LORD is gracious.

CONSTANTLY plead the Promises with God in Prayer. He has thereby bound himself to his People, as with a Note under his Hand. Go with it therefore to God, firmly depending upon his Faithfulness; He will acknowledge his own Handwriting, and answer your Demands accordingly. Rest yourself therefore upon God, and wait patiently for him, being assured he'll not be unmindful of his Promise; but leave it to his infinite Wisdom to fulfil it, in that Way, and at that Time, he sees best.

But remember, The Promises of God do not discharge from, but encourage and oblige to, the diligent Use of all proper and lawful Means. Christ has promised Food and Raiment; but the Slothful and Careless must not expect the Benefit of that Promise. The same may be said of the Spiritual Blessings promised. The Soul of the Slothful desireth, and hath nothing: but the Soul of the Diligent shall be made fat, <ref onclick="bcv(20,13,4)">Prov. 13:4</ref>.

To conclude: Let the Christian live a Life of Faith upon the Promises. A great Part of the Riches of the Nation at this Day, consists in the Credit that is given to Notes, Bonds, Assignments, &c., I am sure that the Riches of the Christian lie chiefly in the Assignments he has under God's Hand, of the most valuable Blessings both of this and a better Life. Let him then know how to value these as the truest Riches, and to make use of them upon all Occasions; he'll find no Want of any good thing. If he has it not in Hand, he has it in the Promise ready whenever he needs it. So that he may live entirely free from Solicitude and anxious Care, committing himself and all his Concerns, to that God who careth for him.

I am willing to take this Opportunity of recommending it to those Young Persons, for whose Benefit this Collection was first undertaken, to persevere in their Endeavours to improve themselves and one another, in the Knowledge of the Promises, and other Parts of Scripture, which may be most useful to them, that the Word of Christ may dwell in them richly in all Wisdom; and to Others, especially of their Age, to imitate their Example in the same commendable Way of employing their Time. To how much better Account will this turn, than the Vanities that ordinarily fill up the Conversation of Youth, or those wrangling Disputes and Controversies, which eat out the Heart of serious, practical Religion! The Advantage which those who have try'd this Course, have reap'd from it, sufficiently encourages their Perseverance in it. May they, and all others, who with them delight in and search after the Treasures of Divine Wisdom in the Scriptures, not only have their minds beautified and enrich'd with it, but feel its Influence in their Hearts and Lives. May they be filled with the Knowledge of the Will of God, in all Wisdom and Spiritual Understanding, that they may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good Work, and increasing in the Knowledge of God.
